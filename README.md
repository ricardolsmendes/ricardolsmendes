Hey there,
I am **Ricardo Mendes**.  

With over 20 years of consulting and software engineering experience across various industries, I have developed a passion for data and its potential to drive innovation and transformation. I now look to practice data leadership from a business outcome-first perspective, chiefly in customer-facing roles.

My technical background includes Python, Java, Google Cloud, AWS, and DevOps, as well as Data Governance, Metadata Management, Data Lineage, and emerging fields such as DataOps and MLOps.
