Hey there,

I am **Ricardo Mendes**, a **Software Engineer** with over 19 years of expertise in architecture and coding :technologist:. My technical proficiency consists chiefly of Java, Python, Google Cloud, and DevOps. However, since 2019 I have been specializing in the data ecosystem: Data Governance, Metadata Management, and emerging fields such as Data Lineage, DataOps, and MLOps.

I enjoy customer-facing roles, sharing knowledge, and I am always looking to practice engineering leadership from a people-first perspective. You can also reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardolsmendes), [Medium](https://ricardolsmendes.medium.com), and [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/ricardomendes).
