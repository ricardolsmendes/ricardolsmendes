Hey there,
I am **Ricardo Mendes**.  

With 20+ years of experience in consulting and software engineering across various industries, I have developed a keen interest in Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning, and, most recently, Generative AI, given their potential to drive business results. For over half a decade, I've joined multidisciplinary teams that help companies make more informed, data-driven decisions.

My areas of expertise include:
- Data and AI solutions architecture in Databricks, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud;
- Data Governance and Observability;
- DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps;
- Python and Java programming.
