Hey there,
I am **Ricardo Mendes**.  

With over 20 years of IT consulting experience, I've been focused on bridging the gap between high-level strategy and daily operations for global leaders such as Google, Ericsson, PepsiCo, JLL, and Domino’s. When navigating complex organizational challenges, I create the cross-functional synergy required to deliver projects successfully.

I am on a mission to align personal pragmatism with the modern need for performance improvement. By leveraging Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning, and Generative AI, I help organizations move beyond intuition and make data-driven decisions.

My areas of expertise include:
- Data & AI Solutions Architecture: Databricks, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
- Trust & Reliability: Data Governance, Data Quality, and Observability.
- Engineering Excellence: DevOps, DataOps, and MLOps.
