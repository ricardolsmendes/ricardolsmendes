Hey there,
I am **Ricardo Mendes**.  

With over 20 years of software engineering and consulting experience across various industries, I have developed a passion for data and its potential to drive innovation and transformation.

My technical background includes Java, Python, Google Cloud, and DevOps, as well as Data Governance, Metadata Management, Data Lineage, and emerging fields such as DataOps and MLOps.

Beyond the hard skills, I look to practice leadership from a people-first perspective and enjoy customer-facing roles.
