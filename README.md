Hey there,
I am **Ricardo Mendes**.  

I count on 20 years of software engineering and consulting expertise in industries such as telco, mining, manufacturing, and, most recently, SaaS.

My technical background is chiefly based on Java, Python, Google Cloud, and DevOps. Since 2019, I have specialized in the data ecosystem: Data Governance, Metadata Management, Data Lineage, and emerging fields such as DataOps.

Beyond the hard skills, I look to practice leadership from a people-first perspective and enjoy customer-facing roles.
